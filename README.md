## About Me
This portfolio covers some of my work as an independent game developer. Most of my experience is invested in Unity and C#, but I have recently begun learning Unreal Engine 5 and C++. While all my work has been purely educational, I believe it serves as a testament to my ability to learn new skills quickly and efficiently.

Currently, I'm working on a few small games from a beginner Unreal course. Coming from a Unity-based game development background, the engine - albeit similar - is completely new to me. My aim is to become proficient in Unreal Engine within the next few months. Beyond the course, I'd like to expand some of the projects I have completed to test myself and my understanding of the engine.

In the future, I would also like to make a MERN stack app that I feel confident adding to my portfolio. While I feel comfortable making web apps, they're often not as efficient or well-written as they could be. Learning to optimise my code for faster load times would boost my confidence in that domain.

## Projects
### Warehouse Wreckage
Warehouse Wreckage is the name of the first module in the course "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games" by GamedevTV. The premise is simple: knock over every object in the room with a limited supply of ammunition. However, the course does not implement any successful end condition; the player can only _lose_. I added a win condition myself, properly telegraphed that information to the player, and - to challenge myself - I did it all using Blueprints.

I learned the fundamentals of Unreal's Blueprints in this module, and I became much more confident navigating Unreal.

### Obstacle Assault
Obstacle Assault is the name of the second module in the course "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games" by GamedevTV. The original core gameplay proposed in this module revolved around completing an obstacle course akin to Fall Guys, but in a singleplayer context. However, as Fall Guys' biggest selling point is its large playerbase, the project played a bit more like a platformer than the gameshow-inspired hit. In the end, I decided it would be more appropriate to create a puzzle platformer style experience for my singleplayer sample level.

While designing my own level, I picked up crucial skills, including:

- using the world blueprint to create event listeners
- creating custom C++ code for actors and manipulating it with Unreal's blueprints

### Coming Soon!
I've already begun work on my next Unreal project! It's very early in development, but this section of the course is a lot longer, and covers a lot of content from both Unreal and C++. I'm hoping this one will give me more freedom to flex my C++ knowledge.
