## About Me
This portfolio covers some of my work as an independent game developer. Most of my experience is invested in Unity and C#, but I have recently begun learning Unreal Engine 5 and C++. While all my work has been purely educational, I believe it serves as a testament to my ability to learn new skills quickly and efficiently.

Most of my projects are still in production to some degree (as is this janky prototype portfolio) and will likely be worked on in real time. I wasn't expecting to apply for anything so soon, but I couldn't pass up an opportunity to work for TT again! So apologies if my projects are a bit underwhelming or unfinished. They're not really here to be impressive however, they're available as proof that I can program to a junior level (hopefully!).

Currently, I'm working on a few small games from a beginner Unreal course. Coming from a Unity-based game development background, the engine - albeit similar - is quite new to me. Beyond the course, I'd like to expand some of the projects I have completed to test myself and my understanding of the engine. I'm also working on a Unity game that was originally going to be my main project. However, as this job requires C++ and Unreal experience, I have put it on the backburner for now and prioritised my Unreal projects. I will still invest time in it if and when I'm able.

In the future, I would also like to make a MERN stack app that I feel confident adding to my portfolio. While I feel comfortable making web apps, they're often not as efficient or well-written as they could be. Learning to optimise my code for faster load times would boost my confidence in that domain.

## Unreal
### Warehouse Wreckage
Warehouse Wreckage is the name of the first module in the course _Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games_ by GameDevTV. The premise is simple: knock over every object in the room with a limited supply of ammunition. However, the course does not implement any successful end condition; the player can only _lose_. I added a win condition myself, properly telegraphed that information to the player, and - to challenge myself - I did it all using Blueprints.

I learned the fundamentals of Unreal's Blueprints in this module, and I became much more confident navigating Unreal.

### Obstacle Assault
Obstacle Assault is the name of the second module in the course _Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games_ by GameDevTV. The original core gameplay proposed in this module revolved around completing an obstacle course akin to Fall Guys, but in a singleplayer context. However, as Fall Guys' biggest selling point is its large playerbase, the project played a bit more like a platformer than the gameshow-inspired hit. In the end, I decided it would be more appropriate to create a puzzle platformer style experience for my singleplayer sample level.

While designing my own level, I picked up crucial skills, including:

- using the world blueprint to create event listeners
- creating custom C++ code for actors and manipulating it with Unreal's blueprints

### Crypt Raider
I've already started work on my next Unreal project! It's very early in development, but this section of the course is a lot longer, and covers a lot of content from both Unreal and C++. I'm hoping this one will give me more freedom to flex my C++ knowledge.

## Unity
### X-Company
X-Company is based off the course _Unity Turn-Based Strategy Game: Intermediate C# Coding_ by GameDevTV and CodeMonkey ([Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-turn-based-strategy/) / [GameDevTV](https://www.gamedev.tv/p/unity-turn-based-strategy/)). This is an intermediate Unity / C# course, with the goal of creating a squad-based strategy game, similar to X-COM or Final Fantasy Tactics. In this project, I'm flying solo as best I can, maintaining both the original codebase _and_ my own version. This project will serve as a test of my abilities to make my own design and implementation decisions based solely off the lecturer's intended outcome.
